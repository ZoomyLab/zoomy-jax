    ``_legacy_module``'s *import* is lazy — but a class body that CALLS it runs

        to_jax -> fvm/__init__ -> solver_imex_jax

    A lazy import inside a function the class body calls buys nothing; the CALL
    has to be deferred too.  First access caches the dict onto the class and
    drops this descriptor, so both `JaxRuntimeModel.module` (class access — what
    the REQ-168 contract test uses) and `self.module` behave exactly like the
    plain dict they were before.
