"""``solver2`` — the v6 unified march, jax reference implementation.

Side-by-side with ``solver_jax.py``; NOTHING is deleted and nothing in the
production path is modified (standing user ruling).  This package is the
reference implementation of
``proposals/2026-07-20-solver-flowcharts-phase1.md`` sections v5 + v6: the
Procedure IR that core will later emit must reproduce these semantics.

What is REUSED UNCHANGED from the existing jax solver
-----------------------------------------------------
* ``zoomy_jax.transformation.jax_runtime.JaxRuntime`` — every kernel:
  ``numerical_flux``, ``numerical_fluctuations``, ``eigenvalues``, ``source``,
  ``boundary_conditions``, ``nonconservative_matrix``, ``update_variables``,
  ``update_aux_variables``.  Not one line of physics is re-derived here.
* ``zoomy_jax.fvm.reconstruction_jax`` — ``ConstantReconstruction``,
  ``LSQMUSCLReconstructionJAX``, ``PositivityPreservingLSQMUSCLJAX``,
  ``EtaWellBalancedLSQMUSCLJAX`` and the limiter/positivity machinery inside
  them, selected by the INHERITED ``HyperbolicSolver._build_reconstruction``.
* ``zoomy_jax.mesh.mesh`` — ``convert_mesh_to_jax``, ``lsq_gradient_per_field``.
* ``HyperbolicSolver.setup_simulation`` (model coercion to NSM, ``dt_max``
  default fill, ``ensure_lsq_mesh``, periodic-BC remap, ``initialize``,
  ``create_runtime``, initial aux + BC sweep) and
  ``HyperbolicSolver._walk_derivative_aux`` (the LSQ derivative-aux walk).
* ``zoomy_core.fvm.timestepping`` semantics for the CFL denominator
  (re-expressed in :func:`blocks.reduce_dt` so the two stored per-face bounds
  feed it directly).

What is NEW here
----------------
The SHELL: the block decomposition, the v6 dt-at-step-head ordering, the
stored face arrays, the fused troubled detection, the Shu-Osher stage form,
the whole-step order-1 MOOD redo, and the fatal dt guard.

Signature deviations from the design text (all deliberate, all minor)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ``dt_pass`` / ``halo_bc`` / ``reconstruct`` / ``mood_resolve`` take ``Ops``
   (and ``halo_bc`` additionally ``p``) explicitly.  The design lists ``Ops``
   only on ``flux_pass``; the kernels these blocks call (``eigenvalues``,
   ``bc_face``, ``reconstruct``) live in ``Ops``, and the BC kernel binds the
   parameter vector.  Nothing else changed.
2. ``reconstruct`` also takes ``bf_values`` from ``halo_bc``.  On an
   unstructured mesh with no ghost CELLS the boundary state IS the per-face
   value ``halo_bc`` synthesises, and the limiter bounds need it.
3. ``gather_update`` takes ``h_index`` so the fused troubled predicate can do
   PAD (``h < 0``) as well as CAD (non-finite).
4. ``mood_resolve`` takes the step's own ``stage_loop`` so the sanctioned
   whole-step order-1 redo owns no scheme logic of its own.
5. ``a_stage`` is the Shu-Osher ``beta``; the ``alpha`` convex combination is
   applied by the stage loop (amendment 14's "Shu-Osher stage form").
