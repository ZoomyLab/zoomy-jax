"""``EmittedMarchSolver`` — the jax adapter for the march EMITTED by core.

This file is the architecture test's jax half.  It contains **no scheme
logic**: every :class:`~zoomy_core.solver.external.ExternalProcedure` body it
supplies is a thin positional shim onto the EXISTING
:mod:`zoomy_jax.fvm.solver2.blocks` implementation.  The march STRUCTURE — the
loop, the step head, the frozen dt, the stage sequence, the build-time
branches, the write cadence, the honesty guards and every constant — comes
from :func:`zoomy_core.solver.march.emit_march` and is lowered by
:class:`~zoomy_core.transformation.procedure_python.ProcedureBuilder`.

If this solver reproduces ``MarchSolver`` bitwise, the emitted march IS the
hand-written one and the other backends become ports.

Nothing in ``solver2`` is modified; ``EmittedMarchSolver`` subclasses
``MarchSolver`` purely to inherit the setup path (``setup_march`` builds
``MeshRT`` / ``Ops``) and the reference blocks.

Two lowering choices, both forced and both worth stating
-------------------------------------------------------
1. **The step is built on the jax backend, the march on numpy.**  The
   ``While`` lowers to ``lax.while_loop`` on the jax backend, and a traced
   loop CANNOT host the FATAL dt guard — the abort would be staged out.  The
   reference march is a plain python ``while`` for exactly this reason, so the
   emitted march is built with ``ProcedureBuilder("numpy")``: at march level
   the only arithmetic is the scalar ``time < t_end`` predicate, all array
   work happens inside the jax-built step.  This mirrors the reference's two
   host dispatches per step (head + step).
2. **The MOOD redo reuses ``MarchSolver.stage_loop``.**  The sanctioned redo
   re-enters the SAME stage sequence at runtime with ``o1=1``.  The IR's only
   branch is build-time and ``o1`` is not a declared argument slot, so the
   emitted step cannot re-enter itself; the redo body therefore calls the
   reference stage loop, which is the same code the emitted sequence shims
   onto block by block.
