"""ChorinSplitVAMSolverJax — JAX port of the NumPy ChorinSplitVAMSolver.

Three-step Chorin projection split for the VAM(1,2,2) chain::

    hyperbolic (Euler) → pressure → corrector

wrapped, when ``time_order == 2``, in the OUTER two-stage SSP-RK2 of
Escalante et al. 2024 (JCP 504:112882, "Time stepping"): the full
projection-correction cycle runs ONCE PER STAGE, the Poisson system is
re-solved in each stage (P is stage-indexed), and the step closes with
``U^{n+1} = ½ U^(0) + ½ U^(2)``.  The per-stage hyperbolic update is a single
Euler step in time (eq. 11) — second order comes from the SPATIAL
reconstruction, not from an inner RK.

Each substep is driven by its own ``JaxRuntime`` over the corresponding
sub-SystemModel (``sm_pred`` / ``sm_press`` / ``sm_corr``).  The
pressure step is matrix-free Newton-GMRES via
:func:`jax.scipy.sparse.linalg.gmres`; the corrector is one
``state_update`` call on ``sm_corr``'s runtime.

Reuses the pure-symbolic helpers from the NumPy implementation
(``_pad_to_square``, ``_substitute_dt``) — those are backend-agnostic.

Status
------
- Predictor: JAX HyperbolicSolver flux loop (symbolic Riemann via
  ``JaxRuntime``).
- Pressure: matrix-free GMRES (``jax.scipy.sparse.linalg.gmres``).
- Corrector: lambdified ``state_update`` from ``sm_corr``.
- Aux pools: per-sub-system, refreshed via LSQ stencils on the mesh
  (mirrors NumPy ``update_aux_variables``).

    The solve TARGETS ``c_elliptic_tol``; it is only declared BROKEN an order
    of magnitude past that, with a floor — because this operator is
    unpreconditioned with an O(1/h²) condition number, so in float64 it cannot
    reliably reach 1e-10 and a gate sitting exactly AT the target turns
    round-off into an abort.  Measured on the smooth fully-wet ladder at n=64:
    rel_resid 5.060e-10 against a target of 1e-10 — a converged solve that the
    at-the-target gate killed at step 2.

    ⚠ DIVERGENCE FLAG, deliberately surfaced rather than buried: this
    expression is a LITERAL in core as well.  It belongs in the EMITTED set
    beside ``c_elliptic_tol`` / ``c_elliptic_restart`` (mandate 6a) and this is
    the second copy of it.  ``zoomy_core`` is another steward's tree, so the

        crash.  ``zoomy_core@676ed2d`` fixed the SYMBOLIC half (``hinv`` now
        survives into ``SM_pred``/``SM_press`` WITH its update rule); this is
        the solver-side half.  The rule is a FULL-LENGTH ``(n_aux, ·)`` vector

        LIVE pressure-derivative entries in ``aux_registry`` and moves the

        ``aux_input_registry`` — the documented contract is that a runtime
        with a private pressure pool fills it from both, once per stage.
        Walking only ``aux_registry`` left every input derivative at 0, so the
