"""Case content for the jax test suite: ICs, BCs, analytic comparisons.

The module the code proposal (``2026-07-20-jax-test-suite-code.md``) names but
does not write.  It owns everything case-shaped so the test files stay short:
initial conditions, boundary conditions, the SWASHES analytic comparison, the
long-march history helper, the Escalante bump comparison and the AHS26 helper.

**Boundary conditions are declared ON THE MODEL, before ``from_model``.**
``SystemModel.boundary_conditions`` is a COMPILED symbolic kernel built at
``SystemModel.from_model`` time, not a declaration slot — assigning a
``BC.BoundaryConditions`` onto a built SystemModel would clobber that kernel.
``models.py`` therefore takes a hashable ``bc`` STRING (so its ``lru_cache``
still keys correctly) and calls :func:`bcs_for` inside to build the live
objects.  Only ``initial_conditions`` is assigned post-build, which is what
the proposal does.

Import style: bare (``from cases import ...``) — see ``conftest.py`` for why
``tests.cases`` cannot be used here.
