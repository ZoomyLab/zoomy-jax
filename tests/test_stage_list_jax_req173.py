"""REQ-173 (jax half): ``stages=[...]`` construction ≡ the positional triple.

core landed the vocabulary in `zoomy_core@5e32610` (`SplitForPressureResult.stages`,
`Stage(label, kind, sm)`, binding BY KIND). This is the jax mirror's gate: the
stage-list constructor must select the SAME three sub-models as the legacy
positional call — same objects, same roles — so the refactor is a renaming of
the dispatch and not a change of numerics.

⚠ What this test canNOT catch, and core's equivalent can't either: a silently
unconverged `elliptic` stage. Both construction paths call the same pressure
primitive, so both reproduce each other bit-for-bit whether or not that solve
converged. Bit-for-bit proves the refactor is clean; it says nothing about
convergence. That is why the `elliptic` contract carries a residual (jax
surfaces it via `jax.debug.print` from inside jit — see `_step_pressure_pure`).
