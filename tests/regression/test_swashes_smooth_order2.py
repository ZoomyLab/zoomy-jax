"""SWASHES subcritical bump — the SMOOTH, wet/wet second-order gate.

The other two SWASHES cases cannot carry a second-order floor and are pinned
instead: ``stoker_wet`` has a shock (measured order-2 rate 1.009, the
shock-pollution cap) and ``ritter_dry`` has a dry front.  This case — SWASHES
3.1.1, subcritical flow over a bump — is smooth and wet everywhere, so it is
the one entitled to a real floor.

THE FLOOR IS > 2, NOT 1.9 (user, 2026-07-22): "1.9 is NOT second order."
``ORDER_FLOOR[2] = 1.9`` is used by the smooth-problem tests elsewhere; it is
deliberately NOT used here.
