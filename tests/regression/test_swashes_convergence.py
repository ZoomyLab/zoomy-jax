    # The floor that used to stand here on stoker_wet was a defect in this
    # test, not a defect in the scheme, and it contradicted a number the same
    # context already records.  MEASURED on this sweep (N = 100/200/400,
    # t = 6 s):
    #
    #   stoker_wet order 1  L1 5.972e-05 / 4.140e-05 / 2.317e-05  rate 0.683
    #   stoker_wet order 2  L1 2.120e-05 / 1.275e-05 / 5.233e-06  rate 1.009
    #
    # The order-2 value 1.009 IS the recorded shock-pollution cap (the
    # intermediate state is subcritical, Fr 0.81; a region decomposition gives
    # 1.06 excluding the shock band and 0.88 in the smooth fan).  Flooring it
    # at ORDER_FLOOR[2] = 1.9 asserted something the physics cannot deliver.
    # The order-1 sweep is still PRE-ASYMPTOTIC — the successive pairwise
    # rates rise 0.53 -> 0.84 across the sweep — so a 3-point fit understates
    # it; that is a property of the sweep, not a regression.
    #
    # The rates are therefore PINNED, not floored: ``refs.check`` compares
    # ``rate`` with ``np.allclose``, so any drift in either direction still
    # fails.  Second order is asserted ONLY on the smooth problems, which is
    # what ``boundary_order2`` and ``vam_order2`` are for.
