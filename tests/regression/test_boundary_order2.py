"""Order 2 must hold IN THE BOUNDARY CELLS, not only in the interior.

The probe is the RETRIEVED acoustic standing wave in a CLOSED BOX (Wall at
both ends, exact closed-form solution) — see ``cases.ACOUSTIC_*`` for the
provenance and for why it replaced the constructed smooth-Dirichlet case.
Two properties make it the right boundary probe:

* the error is measured against a CLOSED FORM, not against a finer run of the
  same code — so a rate below 2 is a statement about the scheme, not about a
  self-reference sharing the scheme's own defect;
* the boundary condition under test IS the Wall, and the wave reflects off
  both ends during the period marched here.

The windowed decomposition (full / interior / left strip / right strip) is
kept: the defect this test exists to catch showed up as an ASYMMETRY between
the two strips, which a full-domain norm dilutes below visibility.
