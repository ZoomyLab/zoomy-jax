"""zoomy_jax test-suite conftest — determinism, tiers, the march helpers.

Determinism:

* ``JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu`` is pinned HERE, at module top, BEFORE any jax /
  zoomy_jax import anywhere in the suite (conftest imports first).
* ``XLA_FLAGS=--xla_force_host_platform_device_count=2`` gives the
  parallelization twin two real CPU devices — also before the first jax
  import, because a test-file-level setdefault would be too late.
* x64 is ASSERTED, not set: ``zoomy_jax/__init__.py`` enables it by default,
  but a stray ``ZOOMY_JAX_ENABLE_X64=0`` in the environment silently flips the
  whole suite to float32 (LSQ error differs ~9 orders).  We hard-fail loudly
  instead of setdefault-ing over it.

Tiers:

* default run = the ``small`` gate tier (seconds per test);
* ``-m regression`` runs the reference marches; ``--run-large`` adds the
  ``@pytest.mark.large`` ones;
* an explicit ``-m`` expression takes over selection entirely.

References: every test compares the FULL ``Q`` and ``Qaux`` against
``tests/refs/<name>.npz`` and records its wall time in
``tests/refs/timings.json`` (see ``refs.py``).  ``--overwrite-results``
regenerates instead of comparing.

DEVIATION FROM THE PROPOSAL (import style, deliberate): the proposal writes
``from tests import models, refs``.  The top-level package name ``tests`` is
already taken by the superrepo (``~/git/Zoomy/tests/__init__.py`` EXISTS,
verified) and this directory has no ``__init__.py``, so ``tests.models`` would
resolve to the superrepo package under a superrepo-wide run.  This directory
is therefore injected onto ``sys.path`` and the shared modules import bare
(``import models, refs``), exactly as ``zoomy_core/tests`` exposes
``goldenlib``.  Module and symbol names are otherwise EXACTLY the proposal's.

Models: ALL derived (user mandate), ALL from the derivation cache.  Shallow
water is SME(level=0).  Wet/dry cap OFF; nothing floors or clips h — the only
depth regularization is the automatic NSM-level KP hinv sweep.
