"""REQ-174 (jax half): the elliptic stage must CONSUME ``SM_press``'s declared
P boundary conditions.

The defect core fixed in `6ac880a` and this mirrors: the pressure solve
hardcoded homogeneous Neumann at every boundary face and never read
``SM_press.boundary_conditions``, so a user-declared Dirichlet P pin was
silently replaced by ``zeroGradient`` — **a well-posed solve of the WRONG
problem**. Not a singularity: the operator is full-rank without any pin
(measured, REQ-172 v3), which is why nothing ever crashed and the bug was
invisible.

⚠ THE JAX-SPECIFIC HAZARD core's equivalent test cannot catch — the two
backends' boundary arguments mean DIFFERENT THINGS:

* numpy ``compute_derivatives(..., u_boundary_face=<FACE values>)`` converts
  internally — ``_resolve_u_boundary_face``: ``ghost = 2·u_face − u_cell``.
* jax ``lsq_gradient_per_field(..., u_bf=<GHOST values>)`` uses the value
  DIRECTLY (``u_bf_delta = u_bf_i − u_i``). **No conversion.**

So the ``2·u_face − u_cell`` lift is the jax caller's job. Passing the bare face
value puts a face-valued sample at the ghost position and silently caps the
boundary gradient at 1st order — it does not raise, it just quietly degrades
(see ``tests/unit/zoomy_jax/test_mesh_derivatives_recent.py``, 4.16 vs 0.024).
``test_pin_is_exact_not_merely_close`` is what actually pins this: a bare-face
bug still moves P toward the pin, so only an exact-to-round-off check separates
"honoured" from "approximately nudged".
