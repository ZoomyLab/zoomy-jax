"""REQ-151 DEFECT D (jax half): the Chorin solver must EVALUATE a plain-Symbol
aux rule, not only derivative-kind aux.

`hinv = KP(h)` is a plain `Symbol`, and every velocity scales by it
(`u = hu*hinv`).  `_refresh_aux_for_sm` historically walked only
`kinds=("derivative","limited_derivative")`, so `hinv` was never evaluated: it
sat at its init value 0 and silently zeroed every velocity — a WRONG-ANSWER
bug, not a crash.  This test pins the fix: after `update_aux_variables()`,
`hinv` must equal `1/h` (to KP desingularisation), not 0.

⚠ Requires the CORE half too: `_pad_to_square`
(`zoomy_core/fvm/solver_chorin_vam_numpy.py`) must carry `update_aux_variables`
onto the padded predictor SystemModel, else the predictor runtime never
lowers the rule and there is nothing for this solver to apply.  While that is
outstanding the test SKIPS with a pointer rather than reporting a false pass —
it flips to a real assertion the moment core lands it.
